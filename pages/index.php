		<p>The Guild of Visual Arts exists to give artists a strong on-campus community where they can develop their skills in a positive group setting. The Guild of Visual Arts aims to connect individuals with artistic interests with one another and provide a forum for members to share their ideas and skills. Furthermore we act as an opportunity for artists to build their professional networks and showcase their works.</p>
